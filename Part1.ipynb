    "#### Project Topic\n",
    "For my project I will be using the \"Higher Education Students Performance Evaluation Dataset Data Set\" from https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Higher+Education+Students+Performance+Evaluation+Dataset. This will be a classification project to determine if there are attributes, or combinations of attributes, that might predict a students' end-of-term performance. The motivation for this project is to 1) put into practice some of the techniques and skills we have learned over the semester and 2) determine if there are attributes (either of the student, their family, or their education habits) that provide a strong correlation for the student doing well or not doing well. An example of the second objective would be to see if having additional work correlates to not doing well or if always attending class correlates to doing well. This will be a particularly interesting topic to explore and to reflect on in regards to have well it fits with my experience in this program so far."

For example, in my hypothesis testing of whether or not having additional work correlated to doing well (or not well) in the class, I would only ignore student's with a \"N/A\" in that sample space.\n",
